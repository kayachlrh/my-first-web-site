<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>slip inside the eye of your mind
don't you know you might find
a better place to play
you said that you'd never been
but all the things that you've seen
will slowly fade away
so i start a revolution from my bed
cos you said the brains i had went to my head
step outside, summertimes in bloom</p>
