<p>stand up beside the fireplace
take that look from off your face
you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
and so sally can wait
she knows it's too late
as we're walking on by
her soul slides away
but don't look back in anger
i heard you say
take me to the place where you go
where nobody knows if it's night or day
please don't put your life in the hands</p>
</body>
