today is gonna be the day</a> <strong>That they're <u>gonna</u></strong> throw it back to you.By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now <img src="ha.jpg" width="450"></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">And all the roads we have to walk along are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
I don't know how</p>
